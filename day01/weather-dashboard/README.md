Weather Data Collection System üå§Ô∏è

Day 1 Project of the 30-Days DevOps Challenge

This project is a Weather Data Collection System that integrates with the OpenWeather API to fetch real-time weather data for multiple cities and stores the data in an AWS S3 bucket. It demonstrates core DevOps principles, such as:

Cloud integration (AWS S3)

External API consumption

Error handling

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles

Environment variable management

Features ‚ú®

Fetch real-time weather data (temperature, humidity, weather conditions).

Automatically uploads the data to an AWS S3 bucket for storage.

Supports multiple cities.

Adds timestamps to all data for historical tracking.

Architecture

Programming Language: Python 3.x

Cloud Provider: AWS (S3)

External API: OpenWeather API Key

Dependencies:

boto3: AWS SDK for Python

requests: For API requests

python-dotenv: For managing environment variables
Setup Instructions üõ†Ô∏è

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-data-collector.git
cd weather-data-collector
2. Create a Python Virtual Environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Configure the Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root directory with the following content:
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your_aws_s3_bucket_name
5. Configure AWS CLI

Ensure you have configured AWS CLI with proper credentials:
aws configure
6. Run the Application

Run the main Python script to fetch and store weather data:
python src/weather_dashboard.py
What I Learned üéì

AWS S3 bucket creation and management.

Environment variable management for secure API keys.

Python best practices for API integration.
