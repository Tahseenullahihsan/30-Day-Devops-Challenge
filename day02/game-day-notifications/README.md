# NBA Game Day Notifications / Sports Alerts System  

## Project Overview  
This project is a cloud-based notification system designed to send real-time NBA game day score updates to subscribed users via SMS or email. It integrates **Amazon SNS**, **AWS Lambda**, **Amazon EventBridge**, and the **NBA APIs** to deliver accurate and timely game information to sports enthusiasts.  

### Key Contributions  
As part of this project, I:  
1. **Integrated NBA API:** Implemented functionality to fetch live NBA scores using the SportsData.io API.  
2. **Developed Lambda Functionality:** Wrote and deployed the main AWS Lambda function to process API responses and send notifications.  
3. **Configured SNS Topics:** Set up Amazon SNS topics for message distribution and managed subscriptions for email and SMS alerts.  
4. **Automated Scheduling:** Utilized Amazon EventBridge to trigger the Lambda function at regular intervals, ensuring automated updates.  
5. **Followed Best Practices:**  
   - Created IAM roles and policies adhering to the principle of least privilege.  
   - Ensured secure integration between AWS services.  
6. **Deployed Infrastructure:** Configured the notification system using AWS services, ensuring seamless integration of all components.  
7. **Debugging and Testing:** Tested the system rigorously using CloudWatch Logs to monitor function execution and resolve errors.
